<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    This is the part where I get to talk about myself! Other than pure self-indulgence,
    I am creating this page so that you can understand a little bit more about who I am and where I come from.

        <h2>I'm a Canadian and a New Zealander</h2>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in the land of sheep, kiwis, and hobbits. I have lived in a few different countries and value those experiences.

<h2>I spent 5 years in the Canadian Forces</h2>
<p>
    Lets just say that the Combat Engineers have fantastic recruiting videos, and that Afghanistan had a lot of sand but no beaches.

<h2>I am a Journeyman Refrigeration Mechanic</h2>
<p>
    An excellent trade. I have now traded in my tools and steel-toed boots for a keyboard and bunny slippers. The work ethic remains the same.

<h2>I run the Edmonton Ruby Meetup at Startup Edmonton</h2>
<p>
    Because programming is about people and Edmonton has a fantastic community. <a href="http://www.yegrb.com/">Learn more at YEGRB.com</a>

        <h2>...and I love to code!</h2>
        <p>
            I greatly enjoy solving problems and getting work done. I cleared IED's in Afghanistan so that our Infantry could live, move and fight on
            the battlefield. I repaired heating and cooling equipment so people and product don't freeze or melt.
        </p>
        <p>
            I bring the same attitude to design and programming. Your problems are my problems and I'm looking forward to working with you to overcome them.
