# 6. Visual Studio Code

Last Updated: 27 Nov 2018

My favourite code editor.

This one is easy! Install the [settings sync extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) and use the gist:

```bash

```

The extensions and settings will be automatically installed for you.
